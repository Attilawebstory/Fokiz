URL Rewrite Module
-------------------------------

This module is an admin-only controller which allows for server-side 301 rewrites to be added 
to the system.

When entered into the interface something like '/old/path' will then push to '/new/path' when 
accessed before any processing occurs.

This is useful in maintaining url structure and avoiding 404's and the effects on SEO when moving 
from another CMS to Fokiz.
