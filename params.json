{"body":"# Fokiz Content Management System\r\n\r\n## Demo Video:\r\n[Watch the Fokiz Demo Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWImWLlWPBA)\r\n\r\n## Description:\r\nFokiz is a content management system built out of a need for a platform that could be quickly deployed, styled and had an absolute minimal learning curve for users. With a simple templating system without lots of custom variables, an easy-to-develop module system for expansion and in-line editing that reflects exactly what content changes will look like, Fokiz is a new style of CMS. No more dashboards, widget managers, or confusing interfaces.\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\nFokiz has very basic system requirements and is built to run on most hosting services. In order to run Fokiz without any modification the following is required:\r\n\r\n* Apache (or compatible server)\r\n* PHP version 5+\r\n* MySQL version 5+\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\nDownload and extract the Fokiz Content Managment System.\r\nEnsure that you have access to a MySQL instance on the server where Fokiz will reside and create a database to contain the system.\r\nOpen the file /config.php in the root of the extracted files and edit the following lines to connect to the database you setup in step 2:\r\n\r\n    define(\"DB_HOST\", \"MYSQL_HOST\");\r\n    define(\"DB_USER\", \"USERNAME\");\r\n    define(\"DB_PASS\", \"PASSWORD\");\r\n    define(\"DB_NAME\", \"DATABASE_NAME\");\r\n\r\nIf you're installing in any directory besides a root directory modify line 34 to contain the path (relative to the webroot with leading and trailing slashes). You will also want to update the RewriteBase? line in /.htaccess to match.\r\n\r\nUpload the contents of Fokiz to the web-root where the files will reside.\r\nModify permissions on the following files and folders to ensure that they can be written to:\r\n   \r\n    /assets\r\n    /sitemap.xml\r\n    /rss.xml\r\n\r\nIf you have suPHP installed this will not need to be done. If you're not sure, simply skip to the next step, the installer will detect if the neccesary permissions are in place.\r\n\r\nUse your web browser to navigate to the web-root of the server. Fokiz will detect that the system needs to be installed and walk you through the rest\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nFor information on customization and working with the system please see [the Fokiz CMS Wiki](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Fokiz/wiki)\r\n\r\n## Sponsorship\r\n\r\nThis project is sponsored and supported by [Tictonix Web Development](http://www.tictonix.com)","tagline":"OSS In-Line PHP Content Management System","note":"Don't delete this file!
